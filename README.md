# stern

Stern allows you to `tail` multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers
within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.

The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and
you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment
id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it
automatically gets tailed.

When a pod contains multiple containers Stern can tail all of them too without
having to do this manually for each one. Simply specify the `container` flag to
limit what containers to show. By default all containers are listened to.
